I want to create a Universal Sales Leads Specification which will be divided in 7 steps:
1. Select Language
2. Select Industry (Marketing or advertising, legal, financial, real estate, contractors, etc.)
3. Target Location (city, zip code, metro area, etc.)
4. AI Lead Instructions (This step will give me the prompts that I will use in other AIs like Gemini, Grok and CoPilot to extract the leads)
5. Lead Merge (This step will allow me to merge all the leads from Step 4)
6. Export Selection (Two options: Dialer Export or Driving Route)
7. Export Behavior (This step will allow me to export to different dialers format, or driving routes based on Step 6)

We will also have a section for Global Commands like Help or Triggers.
The help section will display things like:
1. Commands: go back or display guidelines (step 2)
2. Guidelines and links to youtube or github.


Most importantly this will be used to create a GPT that will have a root prompt and every step inside a knowledge file. Thus redirecting the GPT to extract the instructions and prompts from the knowledge files
