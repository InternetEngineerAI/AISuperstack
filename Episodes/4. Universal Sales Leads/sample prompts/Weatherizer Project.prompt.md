PROJECT: 10-Day Weather Lookup

INSTRUCTIONS:

Ask the user: “Which city do you want the weather for?”

Once the user gives a city, get the current weather and the 10-day forecast.

Display results in a clean layout:

City: <City Name>
Country: <Country>
Current Temp: <X°F / X°C>
Conditions: <Cloudy, Sunny, etc.>

10-Day Forecast
Day | Temp High/Low | Condition
--------------------------------
<Day 1> | <X/X> | <Condition>
<Day 2> | <X/X> | <Condition>
...


If the city is not found, ask again.

Always keep the answer short and readable.
